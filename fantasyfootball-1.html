         <p id="secondmessage">this is the homepage of my Fantasy Football website.This website was made with the intent to show off the teams I created this season of Fantasy Football '
            aswell as explain some of the rules and the scoring system.
         </p>
         <h3>what is fantasy football?</h3>
         <p>When you play fantasy, you make a virtual roster of real NFL players, then compete against other people's rosters, based on the stats of all the players in real games. </p>
         <h3>how do I get a roster?</h3>
         <p>depending on the type of league the roster can be made in two ways.in a season long league you will have what is called a draft.Bytub a daily league you would have player picks</p>
         <h3>what is a draft?</h3>
         <p>In a draft, teams take turns selecting from a pool of eligible players. When a team selects a player, 
            the team receives exclusive rights that player and no other team in the league may sign the player.
         </p>

         <h3>what are player picks?</h3>
         <p>player picks are for daily draft leagues.Each player is given a value and each team is given a budget. the team must create a roster with siad budget from any player.
            the key difference being you cna have the same players as other people as its not an exclusive pool.
